The **Team Lead** automatically:
- Analyzes your requests

- Coordinates complex multi-step tasks
- Provides unified responses

### **🤖 Your Specialized Team**
- **Code Assistant**: Programming, debugging, code review
- **Data Analyst**: Data analysis, statistics, visualization  
- **Customer Support**: Help desk, issue resolution
- **API Integrator**: MCP servers, external integrations
- **Content Creator**: Writing, documentation, creative content

### **🔌 Universal API Access (MCP Integration)**

- Automatic MCP server generation
- Instant API-to-agent integration

## 🌐 **Key Endpoints**

### **Team Communication**
- `POST /team/chat` - **Main entry point** (talk to Team Lead)
- `GET /team/status` - Team member availability
- `POST /team/add-member` - Add specialists
- `POST /team/enhance-member` - Add API capabilities

### **MCP Integration**

## 🎯 **How to Communicate**

**Instead of managing multiple agents, just talk to one Team Lead:**

```bash
# Single entry point for everything
curl -X POST https://web--microsoft-agent-framework--4h7vh8ddvxpx.code.run/team/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Build me a Python web app with authentication"}'

# Team Lead automatically:
# 1. Analyzes the request
# 2. Assigns Code Assistant for backend
# 3. Assigns Security Specialist for auth
# 4. Coordinates the work
# 5. Provides unified response
```
