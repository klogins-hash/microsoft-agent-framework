#### **Data Analysis**
```
"I have sales data in a CSV file. Can you analyze trends and create visualizations?"
```
**What happens**: Team Lead assigns Data Analyst who will guide you through data upload, analysis, and visualization creation.

#### **API Integration**

4. You get a coordinated, complete response
5. Follow-up questions continue the context

### **Team Coordination**
- Complex requests automatically involve multiple specialists
- Team Lead synthesizes responses from different experts
- You see one unified conversation, not multiple agent chats
- Context is maintained across specialist handoffs

### **Real-Time Feedback**
- See when Team Lead is analyzing your request
- Watch team member status change as tasks are assigned
- Get progress updates for long-running tasks
- Monitor overall team performance

## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

### **Static Hosting** (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy 'build' folder to:
# - Netlify (drag & drop)
# - Vercel (vercel --prod)
# - AWS S3 + CloudFront
# - GitHub Pages
```

### **Docker Deployment**
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY build/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80
```

### **Integration with Backend**
The frontend automatically connects to your Microsoft Agent Framework API and uses:
- `POST /team/chat` - Main communication endpoint
- `GET /team/status` - Team member monitoring
- `GET /health` - Connection health checks

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Natural Language**: Talk to the team like you would a human colleague
2. **Context Matters**: Follow-up questions maintain conversation context
3. **Be Specific**: More details help the Team Lead assign the right specialists
4. **Use Team Status**: Monitor which specialists are working on your requests
5. **Complex Projects**: Don't hesitate to ask for multi-step, complex solutions

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

You now have a **single chat interface** that gives you access to an entire team of AI specialists, all coordinated through one Team Lead. No more managing multiple agents - just one conversation that handles everything! ðŸ¤–âœ¨
